tfu- is a randomizer i built to remedy date night option paralysis

(and to familiarize myself with vanilla javascript & styling) 

<ul>
<li>[y/n] - returns either yes or no</li>
<li>[inpt] - use the textfield & [++] to input options - [go] will return one</li>
<li>[otpt] - returns a random restaurant from st. john's metro area</li>
</ul>

i'd like to expand on [otpt] in the future to pull from google maps based on user location
